# Portfolio Website

## Link to deployed project:
https://kristerran.github.io/HomeworkSeven/
## Description
-This website is a basis for the site I will display my work as a developer. The site features a resume page with basic info about my skills, work experience and education, an about me page that will act as a cover letter, and a portfolio page that will show my work.

### Project Motivation:
- I want to be a professional developer, having a page to showcase my work is an important step. I will continue to work on this page and make it as impressive as possible. I hope one day for this page and all of the programs in my portfolio to be ones that I can be fully proud of.

### Project Problem solved:
- My project will make job searches easier, and show hiring managers in one screen, the information they need to choose to hire me.

### Skills Learned during project:
- I learned a lot about css, and the ways it can be used to design and position elements on a page.
